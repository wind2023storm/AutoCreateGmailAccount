## Auto Create Gmail Accounts

### Preparation

1. Python 3.x
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Download [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
5. Copy chromedriver in `/usr/local/bin`

### Run 

`python AutoCreateGmailAccount.py`

- **Step 1**

  You do not need to do anything here. It automaticlly generates popular names for creating gmail accounts. There is only one thing that I need remind you. Username should be <u>Firstname + Lastname + 5 numbers</u>  Sometimes, Username would be mistook to be very long. If this occurs, please stop the script immediately and restart it.
